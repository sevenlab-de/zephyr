description: PWM based DALI interface

compatible: "zephyr,dali-pwm"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  pwms:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

  tx-flank-shift-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      Difference in propagation delay in ns between the falling and rising edge.
      If for example the high to low delay is 8 us and low to high is 22 us, then enter
      (-14) here. Keep in low µs range.

  rx-flank-shift-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      Difference in propagation delay in ns between the falling and rising edge.
      If for example the high to low delay is 47 us and low to high is 15 us, then enter
      (32) here. Keep in low µs range.

  tx-rx-propagation-max-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      The maximal time from a transmitted change to read observation.
      This value needs to be set for proper collision detection.
      The delay is measured in micro seconds.

  rx-finish-work-delay-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      This is the time that elapses from the time the stop bit period has
      expired until the corresponding workqueue processing has started.
      This time depends on the clockrate and architecture of the target system.
      This parameter might need adjustment to pass the test item 3.15 of
      the DALI tests. The delay is measured in micro seconds.

  rx-capture-work-delay-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      This is time that elapses from the moment a DALI bus event is
      captured until the corresponding workqueue pricessing has started.
      This time depends on the clockrate and architecture of the target system.
      This parameter might need adjustment to pass the test item 3.14 of
      the DALI tests. The delay is measured in micro seconds.
