description: counter based DALI interface

compatible: "zephyr,dali-counter"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  counter:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      The counter for signal transmission and receiving.

  chan-id-tx:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Channel for Tx alarm.

  chan-id-collision:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Channel for collision detection alarm.

  chan-id-stop:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Channel for stop condition alarm.

  rx-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO pin that connects to the DALI Rx pin.

  tx-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO pin that connects to the DALI Tx pin.

  tx-flank-shift-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      Difference in propagation delay in ns between the falling and rising edge.
      If for example the high to low delay is 8 us and low to high is 22 us, then enter
      (-14) here. Keep in low µs range.

  rx-flank-shift-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      Difference in propagation delay in ns between the falling and rising edge.
      If for example the high to low delay is 47 us and low to high is 15 us, then enter
      (32) here. Keep in low µs range.

  tx-rx-propagation-max-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      The maximal time from a transmitted change to read observation.
      This value needs to be set for proper collision detection.
      The delay is measured in micro seconds.
